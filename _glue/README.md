# Glue

Glue is a component and utility library for building Google-branded marketing
websites, following the latest Marketing Web Standards (MWS) guidelines. It is
built in TypeScript and Sass, and can be imported/compiled directly into your
project or used via CDN.

Glue releases follow semantic versioning. Users should start with the latest
available version. We encourage users to upgrade Glue to the latest version by
following the migration guide whenever practical.
