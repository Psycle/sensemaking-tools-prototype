There are several methods to contact the Glue developer team and stay informed
of changes to Glue.

## Announcements

Join one of these lists to be informed of updates and changes to the Glue
library.

-   glue-announce@google.com (g/glue-announce)
    -   For internal users of Glue (Google employees and TVCs). Announcements
        only, focused on when new versions of Glue are published to npm.
-   glue-users-external@google.com (g/glue-users-external)
    -   For external users of Glue (agencies and vendors). To gain access, make
        sure you are a member of your agency's
        `agency-code-AGENCYNAME-external@google.com` group (managed by the ATL
        team). If your agency group does not yet have access to the Glue group,
        contact the Glue team (glue-eng-core@google.com) to get added. For
        announcements and general discussion.
-   glue-users-internal@google.com (g/glue-users-internal)
    -   For internal google3 users, to be informed of potentially breaking
        changes and new features as they are added. Note that if your code is
        affected by a breaking change, your team will also be informed directly.

## Chat room

[Glue Users (external)](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAA1UAVNJU) is the Google
Chat room for Glue users to ask questions and get help from other users and from
Glue developers. It is the **preferred method** for users to contact the Glue
team about general questions and requests. It is available to external users.

Glue dev team aims to respond to chat inquiries within 3 business days.

Contact glue-eng-core@google.com if you have trouble getting access.

    -   General Glue discussion by users, with monitoring by Glue devs. For
        internal users.

        sure you are a member of your agency's
