## Features

-   Apply elevation styles with a class or a mixin

## Setup

### SCSS

This is a layout overrides component, and should be imported after Glue core
layout components and UI components.

```scss
// Import Glue core layout components
@use '@google/glue/lib/core';

// Import Glue UI components

// Import Glue layout overrides
@use '@google/glue/lib/elevation';
```


### HTML

Add the class `glue-elevation-level-N` to any element, replacing `N` with the
elevation level between 0–5. Note that 0 elevation is a hairline border, not an
actual shadow.

```html
<div class="glue-elevation-level-1">
  This is at level 1 elevation.
</div>

<div class="glue-elevation-level-3">
  This is at level 3 elevation.
</div>
```

## Variations

## Via mixin

Alternatively, use the mixin `set-level($level)` directly in your styles, where
`$level` is the elevation level between 0–5. This is useful if you need to
change the elevation level due to interaction.

### SCSS

```scss
@use '@google/glue/lib/elevation/mixins' as glue-elevation-mixins;

.foo {
  // Resting state is at level 0 elevation
  @include glue-elevation-mixins.set-level(0);

  &:hover {
    // Changes to level 1 elevation on hover
    @include glue-elevation-mixins.set-level(1);
  }
}
```
